# butterflyApp

Lauch from terminal by typing 

npm start 

from inside the directory.

This a 1 page javascript app that allows a user to choose their emotion and answer a few questions.
I used a little bit of routing simply to show that I know how to do it. Originally I built everythign on unique pages and routed between them, but that did not seem very DRY so I moved everything to 1 page. 

I have never used full stack JS before, so I am probably not following a lot of conventions. 

The submit button checks to see if each question has been answered, I know not all fields are required but I wanted to show some simple client side validations.

The question order is randomized when a user chooses the original emotion. 

I used radio-buttons instead of a slider because it would have been very time consuming to show the animation of the bar moving to the correct button. 

I used screenshots of the faces, so their sizes vary a bit. 

The app is fully responsive.
